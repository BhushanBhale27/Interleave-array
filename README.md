### -For example, if you have two arrays A and B with elements [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6], respectively, you can interleave these arrays to form a new array C with elements ### -[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6].

### -The goal of interleaving two arrays is to create a new array that combines the elements of both arrays in a specific pattern, often alternating between elements of ### -the two arrays.
